                    <span> Being the first PI, I spent this whole summer vacation with these high school students who are interested deeply in Synthetic Biology and iGEM. I enjoyed meeting and working alongside so many driven young individuals, who worked tirelessly to bring their ideas to life. I’m so proud of these young girls and boys. I am a quiet person, but I love to stay with these young people, because they can influence me with their energy and vitality. Besides the work, I love to travel, do yoga and spend time with my friends and family!</span>

And I found I was interested in Synthetic Biology and iGEM gradually. I really enjoyed seeing that my students were doing experiments in the lab. iGEM offers them an amazing opportunity to make their idea to reality. This is the first iGEM team in Shandong province. I hope these students can continue this activity, which let more and more students to participate in iGEM</span>

Passion and enthusiasm are the two most important things accompanying my teaching work, so I spare no effort in helping my brilliant students to go forward. I pay hard effort, but meanwhile, I gain much more than that. It is their bright future that lights my teaching career. Besides those mentioned above, I am also a big fan of sports after work. Exercise is not only a good way to help me keep fit, but also a fantastic means to grow up with teenagers, which blazes one more trail to communicate with other guys sharing the same interests.</span>

In the whole processes, I sensed the passion of these high school students in this summer. All of them are very interested in Synthetic Biology and iGEM competition. They worked hard and sometimes they worked till the midnight in the lab. However they learned a lot and they are growing researchers. They had lot of fun in this summer!</span>

I love reading, which can give me happiness and quiet. I really enjoy my life now, although I still have many dreams to chase. In this summer, being an advisor, I got involved in iGem and synthetic biology. I think iGEM is the perfect competition to prove the ability of someone. I really enjoy the engineering aspect design with the high school students in iGEM competition.</span>

Those hobbies makes me happy and I can relax from academic projects. Besides doing some experiments, I am also responsible for math modeling in our team. I love the process of research: coming up with a fresh idea, designing experiments to solve a problem, and finally getting an answer.

                    Some say that the 21st century is belongs to biology. I totally agree. There is a bright future in the future of biology even though the road of which is a long and twisty one.
                    But still, my friend, we need carry on. No matter what kind of obstacle is waiting for us, there is no chance for us to run away like a coward. Biologists are explorers and the one who have passion and will of carry on.</span>
